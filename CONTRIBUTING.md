# Contributing Guidelines

Given the scale of our project and the amount of users we have - tens of thousands - we must take care in making sure our contributing process is efficient, but done with scrutiny and caution.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the Repository: Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account
2. Clone the Repository: Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a Branch: Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.

```git checkout -b NAME/branch name```

4. Commit Changes: Use Conventional Commits for your commit messages. Be descriptive but brief. Example:

```git commit -m "feat: add new feature"```

6. Push changes
5. Submit a Pull Request (PR): Open a pull request from your branch to the main repository's main branch. Provide a clear and concise description of your changes.
7. Submit the PR to our #utrp-pr-review channel on our team's Discord, so other devs can review it and start conversations there
